# PRO TIPS :bulb:

---

## PRO TIP :bulb:
- In order to finish on time, you will have to split up features or objectives.  
- Pair programming can be very helpful depending on the task.  Use your best judgement.  
- You'll always think you have more time than you do - DON'T PUT STUFF OFF.

---

## PRO TIP :bulb:

- Divide your time wisely between lab time projects and your capstone.  Both are beneficial and important to your education.
- Don't work on personal or outside projects during capstone time.  It's not fair to yourself or your team.
