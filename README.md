# STRUCTURE

## submit ideas before Lab time Thursday

Everyone must submit something.  Use the Google form.

---

## pitch ideas to class Thursday

Every student must pitch.  No big presentation, just an explanation of your idea and why people would like it.

---
# Submit
## Which ideas and who you would like to work with.

Make sure to submit a top choice and a second choice. This must be done by Wednesday so you have enough time!  If you don't submit anything, we will put you where we think you fit best.

---

## 4-member groups

Too big, and things get hard to manage, people don't do their part.  Too small and not enough can get done.

---

## Final groups announced on Friday

# PRO TIPS :bulb:

---

## PRO TIP :bulb:
- In order to finish on time, you will have to split up features or objectives.  
- Pair programming can be very helpful depending on the task.  Use your best judgement.  
- You'll always think you have more time than you do - DON'T PUT STUFF OFF.

---

## PRO TIP :bulb:

- Divide your time wisely between lab time projects and your capstone.  Both are beneficial and important to your education.
- Don't work on personal or outside projects during capstone time.  It's not fair to yourself or your team.
